In the open source universe, using terms such as *FLOSS* (Free/Libre and Open Source Software) is common and represents a casual conflation of the terms *[open source][]* and *[free software][]*, which are often used interchangeably. I would be remiss if I didn't also admit that I have been guilty of same. I won't be doing that anymore—or at least I'll try not to—for a simple reason: Using the terms interchangeably is dangerous to the goals of free software and open media advocates (read "anti-DRM"). To continue this practice is to undermine beliefs that are fundamental to free software and associated movement.

在開源世界裡，使用類似*FLOSS*(Free/Libre and Open Source Software，自由和開源軟體)的術語很常見，代表*[open source][]*(開放原始碼)和*[free software][]*(自由軟體)這兩個術語的隨意混淆。而這兩個術語通常可以混用。
如果我不承認我也這麼做，那麼我實在是失職了。
我不會再做這種事，或至少我會嘗試不再做，因為一個簡單的理由：將這些術語混用，對於自由軟體和開放媒體的倡導者(例如反DRM)的目標很危險。
繼續這種做法就是破壞自由軟體和相關運動最基本的信念。

## Free software is about freedom

Free software is a social movement, with nary a hint of business interests—it exists in the realm of religion and philosophy. Free software is a way of life with a strong moral code. Central to the spirit of *free software* is the idea that everyone should be able to use, modify, and share, with a defined limitation that you can't modify without sharing. This is the origin of the "free software is a virus" meme that makes the [GNU GPL][] seem especially scary to some business folks. To embrace free software is also to embrace sharing culture and mandate sharing, which is a step too far for most businesses. The point of free software was to undermine the existing order of proprietary Unix vendors and enforce principles of sharing. And when it comes to espousing that freedom, it's difficult to embrace the free software culture and philosophy without also acknowledging the onging fight for unlocked devices, open media formats, net neutrality, and safety from private as well as government surveillance. For the rest of this post, I'll use "Free Software" as shorthand for all of those movements.

## 自由軟體是為了自由

自由軟體是個社會運動，連一點商業利益都沒有——它存在於宗教和哲學的領域。
自由軟體是個有強烈道德規範的生活方式。
*自由軟體*的中心精神就是「每個人都應該有辦法使用、修改和分享」的想法，再加上明確的限制：「你不能只修改而不分享」。
這就是「自由軟體是病毒」這個模因(meme)的來源。這句話使得[GNU GPL][]成為商業人士似乎很害怕的東西。
擁抱自由軟體也是擁抱分享文化和任務共享，而這對大多數的企業而言都太超過了。
自由軟體當時發起的目的就是要破壞專有的Unix廠商的秩序，並實施共享的原則。
而一提到支持自由，就會發現很難擁抱自由軟體的文化和理念，而不承認人們為了解鎖的裝置、開放的媒體格式、網路中立，隱私安全和政府監視而持續爭鬥。
在這篇文章，我會用「自由軟體」來簡稱以上所有的運動。

## Open source is about something else entirely: Supply chain efficiency

When I wrote *[There is no Open Source Community][]* a decade ago, I asked the question, "Why do developers release open source code?" As it turns out, there are good reasons for doing so from an operations standpoint.

## 開源軟體完全是另一回事：為了生產效率

在我十年前寫*[There is no Open Source Community][]*(英文)這篇文章時，我問道：「為何開發者要釋放開放原始碼？」
後來發現，從生產的角度看，有很好的理由。

To embrace open source is to embrace a development model that utilizes a decentralized supply chain. Whereas before, proprietary vendors would control the entire software supply chain in-house, the open source model directly refutes that approach. The open source model is about using common components of multiple origins to achieve higher efficiency and agility in creating software-based products and services.

擁抱開放原始碼就是擁抱利用去中心化的供應鏈的發展模型。
和以往，專有軟體公司在內部控制整個軟體供應鏈，相反的是，開源軟體模型直接駁斥這個做法。
開源軟體模型就是用多個來源的共同原件來達成更高效率和敏捷度，以製造奠基於軟體的產品和服務。

Initially, open source projects did heavily use GPL'd software, due to the fact that the GNU project was started some 10 years before the first Linux kernel, and at least 15 years before the term *open source* was coined. The effect of this head start was that by the time open source as a business-friendly concept gained steam, there was already a wealth of GPL'd code—not to mention a well-developed culture of sharing.

一開始，開源軟體確實大量使用GPL的軟體，因為GNU專案在第一個Linux核心出現的大約10年前，同時是*開源(open source)*這個術語出現以前至少15年就開始了。
這個開端的效應就是，在開源軟體作為對商業友善的概念興起前，就已經有許多的GPL程式——更別提良好發展的共享文化。

That there is now a trend of new open source projects migrating away from copyleft GPL-style licenses toward "liberal" Apache-style licenses should come as no surprise. In retrospect, this was inevitable. In a world defined by business interests and not philosophy, enforced sharing doesn't really make sense. Sure, one could argue that it does. After all, lots of companies have formed profitable ecosystems around GPL'd GNU and Linux code. But let's assume that most business types disagree with the whole enforced-sharing bit.

對於現在新的開源軟體專案從copyleft GPL風格的授權條款遷移到「自由」的Apache風格的授權條款的趨勢不應該感到驚訝。
回想起來，這是無可避免的。
在一個由商業利益而不是由道義定義的世界裡，強制共享並不真的有意義。
當然，人們可以說它有意義。
畢竟，許多公司已經藉著GPL的GNU和Linux代碼建立有利可圖的生態系統。
但讓我們來假設，大部分的業務類型不同意整個強制分享這一塊。

In the Apache-style open source model, developers can choose whether or not to release their modifications. They often do, simply because they have realized the benefits of participating in open source ecosystems—but there are many who sometimes do not. In an open source world, this simply doesn't matter. If the point of open source development is to optimize your supply chain and economies of scale, who cares about sharing?

在Apache式的開源模型裡，開發者們可以選擇是否釋出他們的修改。
他們通常這麼做，只因為他們已經意識到參與開源生態的益處——但是有很多人有時不這麼做。
反正這在開放原始碼的世界裡根本不重要。
如果開源的開發目的是在優化你的供應鏈和規模經濟，那誰在乎分享？

## Open source victory

It's important to remember that in *[The Cathedral and the Bazaar][]* Eric S Raymond specifically called out the open source model as superior, which was the beginning of the great cultural divide: Open source was all about better software and "given enough eyes, all bugs are shallow"; and free software was about an enlightened existence through sharing. The point of view that open source was a superior model turned out to be mostly correct, as open source has become the preferred model for technology innovation. Open source processes could give vendors a competitive advantage, if used properly, and open source principles could allow projects to function more efficiently.

## 開源軟體的勝利

重要的是，在*[大教堂與市集][]*這篇文章，Eric S Raymond特別呼籲開放原始碼模型較為優越，而這就是文化大鴻溝的開端：開放原始碼的宗旨是為了更好的軟體以及「只要有足夠的眼睛，所有的臭蟲(bug)都會浮現」；自由軟體則是藉由分享而得到開明的存在。
「開源是優越的模型」這個觀點大部分都是正確的，因為開源已經成為技術創新的首選模型。
開放原始碼的流程，如果使用的當，可以讓廠商取得競爭優勢，而開源的原則可以使專案更有效率的運行。

Ironically, it's this impressive open source victory—or at least our interpretation of it—that presents a real threat to free software. When these terms are used interchangeably, there is no room for nuance or differentiation. Thus, the open source victory becomes a free software victory, without the slightest question of whether that actually is the case.

諷刺的是，就是那令人欽佩的開源勝利——或至少是我們對它的解讀——對自由軟體造成真正的威脅。
當這兩個用詞被混用，這兩個詞就沒有差異的餘地。
於是，開源勝利就變成了自由軟體的勝利，一點都沒有質疑是否真的是如此。

But has free software actually *won*? Let us consider an alternative, that *victory* for free software looks very different from open source. If an open source victory looks like higher efficiency and more innovation in open source ecosystems, what does a free software victory look like?

然而自由軟體真的*獲勝*了嗎？
我們考慮另一個情況，那就是自由軟體的*勝利*看起來跟開源非常不一樣。
如果開源的勝利在開源生態裡是更高的效率和更多創新，那自由軟體的勝利又是如何呢？

## If free software 'won'

If we start with the premise that free software is about a philosophy of sharing and a moral code built around that, then what would it mean if the philosophy of free software was just as successful as open source principles? If I'm correct that they are different, then surely the success of this philosophy and moral code would manifest itself in ways different from what we see now.

## 如果自由軟體獲勝

如果我們將「自由軟體是關於共享的哲學以及圍繞著它的道德規範」當作前提，那麼如果自由軟體的哲理和開源原則一樣成功，又是意味著什麼呢？
如果我是對的，它們確實不同，那麼很肯定的，這種哲理和道德規範的成功會以不同於我們現在所見的方式表現出來。

In a world in which free software wins, are locked-down cloud architectures dominant? Would most hand-held devices be proprietary and difficult to change? Would it be difficult to use any service on any platform? Would we so easily hand over our privacy to media companies? Why, then, in a world in which open source is hyper-successful, are all of the above true? If we declare that open source has won—and I believe it's safe to do so—how could we possibly declare that free software has also won? This is where the conflation of terms is actively toxic. By using them interchangeably, you are taking the air out of the sails of free software advocates everywhere who want to ensure sharing in the cloud, freedom on the web, equal access to technology, and improved privacy for everyone.

在自由軟體獲勝的世界裡，封閉的雲端架構會占主導地位嗎？
大部分的攜帶型裝置會是專有的而很難更改嗎？
在任何平台上使用任何服務會很難嗎？
我們會此輕易的就把隱私交給媒體公司嗎？
那麼，為什麼在開源超級成功的世界裡，上述都是真的？
如果我們宣告開源已經獲勝——我相信這麼做是安全的——那我們怎麼可能宣告自由軟體也獲勝了呢？
這就是混淆術語很危險的由來。
在你混用這些術語的時候，你也在將空氣從各地自由軟體擁護者的「帆」中抽走，這些擁護者想要確保雲端共享、網路自由、科技使用的平等以及改善每個人的隱私權。

When free software advocates speak up, many open source supporters would rather that they just shut up and went away. I was in a conversation some months ago in which I mentioned that we needed to educate people about open source principles. My mistake. See what conflation of those two things gets us? One technology executive responded, "Do we really need that anymore?" The impression among some open source supporters is that, because open source has won, the "free market" will take care of it, and we needn't worry ourselves with this philosophical stuff. Thus, there's no need to lobby governments on standards, privacy, and free software, because, hey, the invisible hand of the market is guiding us all in the right direction. With the success of open source due to market trends, there is far too much lackadaisical thinking about moving technology-culture forward.

當自由軟體倡導者大聲的說出來，許多開源擁護者寧可閉嘴而離開。
在幾個月前的一次對話中，我提到我們需要教導人們開放原始碼的準則。
我說錯了。
看看把這兩個概念混用帶給了我們什麼影響？
一些開源支持者的感想是，因為開源已經勝利，所以「自由市場」會處理一切，我們不需要為這種哲理的事而擔心。
因此，不需要遊說政府關於標準、隱私和自由軟體的事，因為，嘿，市場無形的手會帶領我們走對的路。
隨著開源在市場趨勢下的成功，現在實在太缺乏推進技術文化的思想了。

Also, I can't resist pointing out that this type of magical thinking is eerily similar to Francis Fukuyama's theory in 1989 from *[The End of History and the Last Man][]*, that the world's societies and nation states were moving inexorably towards more freedom and democracy. How has that worked out for two-thirds of the world's population?

此外，我不能不指出，這種魔法般的思維和法蘭西斯·福山在1989年的[《歷史之終結與最後一人》][]中提出的理論十分相似，那就是世界上的社會和民族國家都不可抗拒的走向更自由、民主。
這對世界上三分之二的人口有何影響？

## Free software is important in its own right

We risk losing an entire generation to a rental culture, not actually owning anything digital or controlling the means by which we can interact with our media and devices. By not embracing free software ideals, we risk undermining the necessary work done by free software advocates. The ideals of free software necessitate a modification and sharing culture to keep our corporate overlords in check, something we're rapidly losing on modern cloud, web, and IoT platforms. If we were able to mandate free software principles, frankly, the world would be a better place. I wouldn't have to use a specific platform just so I could access technology services I paid for. Poor students around the world wouldn't face more obstacles to educational opportunities. Underrepresented communities would have more power to control their own destiny and create successful communities that they could leverage as a counterweight to the rest of the world that would rather institute the status quo.

## 自由軟體本身就很重要

我們可能把整個世代輸給租賃文化，無法真的擁有數位的產物，也無法控制我們和自己的媒體與裝置的互動方式。
如果不擁抱自由軟體的理念，我們就有可能破壞自由軟體推動者已達成的必要工作。
自由軟體的理念需要有修改並分享的文化，以抑制企業霸主。而我們卻在現代雲服務、網路以及IoT平台這些地方快速的落敗給它們。
如果我們有辦法強制執行自由軟體的原則，那麼坦率地說，世界應該會更美好。
我就不用使用特定平台，只為了能使用我花錢取得的服務。
世界上的窮學生也不會在教育機會上遇到這麼多的障礙。
代表性不足的社群會有更大的權力來控制自己的目標，並創造出成功的社群，可以和寧可維持現狀的其他地方抗衡。

We should all be working to ensure that we own the technology on our devices, that we own our information, and that we can defend our privacy. Whoever owns the information that governs our lives owns the pathways to our thoughts and mechanisms for future monopolies, which *does* have a real economic impact.

我們都應該努力，確保我們擁有我們裝置的技術，擁有自己的資訊，並可以保護自己的隱私。
擁有能支配我們生活的資訊的人，就擁有我們的思想和機制的途徑，能夠給未來的壟斷者，而這可就 *真的* 會有經濟衝擊了。

Well, I guess I couldn't get away from the economic argument after all: Ignore free software philosophy and ideals, and risk a terrible future with imposed limits on freedom of expression, thought, and, yes, commerce.
